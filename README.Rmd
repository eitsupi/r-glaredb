# R bindings for GlareDB

Check out the [GlareDB repo](https://github.com/GlareDB/glaredb) to learn more.

Use GlareDB directly in R to query and analyzer a variety of data sources, including `arrow::Table` and `polars::RPolarsDataFrame`.

```{r}
library(glaredb)
library(polars)

df = pl$DataFrame(
  A = 1:5,
  fruits = c("banana", "banana", "apple", "apple", "banana"),
  B = 5:1,
  C = c("beetle", "audi", "beetle", "beetle", "beetle")
)

df2 = glaredb_sql("select * from df where fruits = 'banana'") |>
  as_polars_df()

df2
```
